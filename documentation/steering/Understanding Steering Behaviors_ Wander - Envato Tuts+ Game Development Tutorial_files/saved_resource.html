Below is my public Dropbox, Unity Web Player build (free downloadable plugin for your browser to play Unity games) of 3D wandering 'fish' and boids. It still has the PC GUI elements in the corner and they only control the initial red boid when you start the app and not other created boids, so there are some unimplemented stuff there. There's also no object avoidance or any other behaviours yet, but the boids do have mesh colliders which bounce off of other colliders in the scene, which sends them in another direction (hopefully, away from the walls...).

<p>Hello, <br>This is a very good tutorial. I implemented this in game maker but in order for my result to be as smooth as yours I had to make the circle very very small. Does that indicate that I might be doing something wrong here? As soon as the circle has like 10 pixel in diameter it starts get kind of jerky. I tried to follow the tutorial as closely as I could (game maker doesnt really have all these nice vector functions) and the result indicates that I've done it correctly. But again I had to make a really small circle in order for it to be smooth. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Hi! Thank you! The symptoms you described are usually related to non-normalized vectors. Another thing that could cause this is that the steering force is too "strong", causing the entity to steer/move very abruptly (causing the jerky movement).</p><p>Maybe you are not dividing the steering force by the entity's mass? You can check the first tutorial (seek) on this steering behaviors series in order to check if your code is similar to that initial version. The problem might not be in the wander part, but in the part that uses the steering force to move things around.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for doing these tutorials! I'm reading through this series and it's been a great supplement to the Unity C# AI programming books I've also been reading. I started coding a couple of years ago with AS3 but moved to UnityScript and then C# recently and am now learning about vectors, so your tutorials are being a great help. Your teaching method is excellent and with your help, I'm getting closer to designing and developing my fishing game, and learning more about programming AI movement.</p><p>One small criticism for this particular tutorial though, I was a little disappointed you didn't extend the first part's random target position seeking behaviour with part two's circle-steering behaviour. It would be nice to see how using circle-steering (or displaced steering vs. positional steering) mitigates the sudden change in direction like we see in the first example Flash program. That said, it's not hard to imagine what it would look like (or how to implement it), but I think your tutorial would be better if it showed this specific difference.</p>

<p>You are welcome and thank YOU for such nice words! I'm really glad to know about your game!</p><p>About your critic, thanks! I didn't thought about improving the first example because I was following Craig Reynolds original approach. Your suggestion is a nice addition and I also imagine it could mitigate the sudden changes in direction.</p><p>Unfortunately it must be an exercise for the reader, because I can't add more content to the tutorial at the moment.</p>

<p>Hey Fernando. I just posted a reply to you with a bitly (link shortener site) link to my public Dropbox of my 3D wandering behaviour I did in Unity (the link being the web player build) and the comment seems to have been removed. Are we not allowed to post links in the comments? Sorry, it's my first time posting links on this site.</p>

<p>Hey there! As far as I can see, your comment is on the moderation queue. I will try to check that.</p><p>About your demo, it's really awesome! Congrats! :D I am glad to hear you needed few lines of code to produce something that cool. When I first saw steering behaviors in action, I had this very same thought: I can do so much with so little! That was my main motivation to start this steering series.</p><p>Keep up the great work!</p>

<p>Hey Fernando!</p><p>Just an update. Below is my public Dropbox, Unity Web Player build (free downloadable plugin for your browser to play Unity games) of 3D wandering 'fish' and boids. It still has the PC GUI elements in the corner and they only control the initial red boid when you start the app and not other created boids, so there are some unimplemented stuff there. There's also no object avoidance or any other behaviours yet, but the boids do have mesh colliders which bounce off of other colliders in the scene, which sends them in another direction (hopefully, away from the walls...). Check it out:</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qQM5K8" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1qQM5K8</a></p><p>I'm also reading through Reynold's papers and finding them to be very informative. I'm actually quite amazed how little code was required n C# to create something enjoyable to watch and tinker with.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
