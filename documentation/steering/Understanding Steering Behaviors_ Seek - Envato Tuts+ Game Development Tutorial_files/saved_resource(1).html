I finally figure out the reason why I can not get it. Steering Behaviors is kind of Game AI.That means we can not ignore the context we use it.So I will use it in my gameplay logic under a game engine.The various kinds of steering behaviors create various forces during each game loop and \"Seek force\" is one of them.The acceleration is involved anyway , because the whole simulation is based on physics formular , so that there are different kinds forces there. But it seems that we always stay focus on velocity rather than force or acceleration because of the first reason caused me confused that the MASS we used for every game object here is default considered as 1(not necessary).So the calculation process is simplified and \"a = F/M\" is equal to \"a = F\" at the same time.\nAnother reason is a bit obscure and prone to be ignored. Based on the Euler integration , we do the update each frame during delta_t. And the definition of acceleration is the change rate of velocity by time.It indicates that the \"Seek force\" we calculated is just the \"change\" part of the velocity and this happens during the delta_t.

Steering Behaviors is kind of Game AI.That means we can not ignore the context we use it.So I will use it in my gameplay logic under a game engine.The various kinds of steering behaviors create various forces during each game loop and \"Seek force\" is one of them.The acceleration is involved anyway , because the whole simulation is based on physics formular , so that there are different kinds forces there. But it seems that we always stay focus on velocity rather than force or acceleration because of the first reason caused me confused that the MASS we used for every game object here is default considered as 1(not necessary).So the calculation process is simplified and \"a = F/M\" is equal to \"a = F\" at the same time.\u003cbr>Another reason is a bit obscure and prone to be ignored. Based on the Euler integration , we do the update each frame during delta_t. And the definition of acceleration is the change rate of velocity by time.It indicates that the \"Seek force\" we calculated is just the \"change\" part of the velocity and this happens during the delta_t. So the whole picture is that:\u003cbr>F = ma = 1 x \"Seek force\" = desired_velocity - current_velocity.\u003cbr>And we can make Mass to be any number we want and the Steering Behaviors still make sense.By the way, we can not think something in an isolated way , because the whole thing is a big system that can do work.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":1},{"forum":"gamedevtuts","parent":2325927130,"isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"dovyski","about":"","name":"dovyski","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.3279649999999998,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/dovyski/","url":"","reputation":1.3279649999999998,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2011-06-19T15:18:29","id":"12750191","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/dovyski.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/1275/191/avatar32.jpg?1451231939"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/dovyski.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/1275/191/avatar92.jpg?1451231939","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/dovyski.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/1275/191/avatar92.jpg?1451231939"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"Awesome!

<p><a data-dsq-mention="dovyski:disqus" href="https://disqus.com/by/dovyski/" rel="nofollow" data-action="profile" data-username="dovyski" class="mention">dovyski</a> I thank you for this tutorial and it is really helpful. But when I come to velocity and force , I get a bit confused. Based on my understanding ,  the "steering" is calculated with two velocity(desired velocity and current velocity) , so how come "steering" ended up becoming  a force which gets involved in the calculation "steering = steering / mass". So my question is if "steering" is a force or a velocity? I hope I can get the answer as soon as possible , because I've been stucking on this for quit a while. Thank you!</p>

<p>I am glad you like it! Your question is really interesting and the answer lays on the point of view. Both "desired_velocity" and "velocity" are a math vectors, which means they have a direction and a length/size/magnitude. In simple words, they can be seen as virtual "arrows" that point towards something.</p><p>If you think of forces (e.g. gravity, even velocity, etc), they can be represented by math vectors as well. They point to something. In the case of the velocity, it points towards the point where the entity is moving to. By using Euler integration, we add the velocity vector to the position vector, which makes the position change according to the size/length/magnitude of the velocity vector.</p><p>In the case of seek steering behavior, the "steering" force is nothing more than a math vector that is carefully calculated to push the entity towards the seek destination. "steering" is a force/vector, the same way "velocity" ou "desired_velocity" are forces/vectors. And that's the power in steering behaviors: since everything is a math vector, you can combine/add them easily. That's why you can make an entity seek ("seek steering force") a place at the same time it avoids an obstacle ("avoidance steering force"): you add both steering forces to produce a new one.</p><p>Is it clear now?</p>

<p>I'm still confused by this. I know the velocity 、force 、acceleration are all vector. But how come "steering" in formular "steering = desired_velocity - velocity" becomes into a force rather than a velocity? why does this make sense? As you mentioned,"since everything is a math vector, you can combine/add them easily", does it mean that we can mix them in one calculation? Do you mean that a velocity vector add or subtract another velocity vector can product a force vector? if not , why the result is called "force"? I know how the steering behaviors work in AI. The key point of achieving this is that we can sum up all the different steering forces together and get a result total force. This total force can be used in formular "a = F/m" to get the acceleration. After that , we can use this acceleration to calculate new position and velocity of object in game loop update. <br>Based on my view , the "F" should be steering force , but I'm stucking on understanding the way to calculate it.</p>

<p>You can call "steering" a velocity, but it is just a label. As you said, they are all vectors, so "steering" is a vector too. I called it a force because it makes more sense to me: it is something that will "push/pull" the entity towards a location.</p><p>When I say vectors can be combined/added, I mean math vector arithmetics. Say vectors V (velocity), S (seek) and A (avoidance), I can obtain a vector T by doing T = V + S + A. Vector T will be the sum vectors V, S and A and, in practice, it is a vector that can be used to move an entity by a determined velocity at the same time it tries to seek a location and avoid something.</p><p>Regarding your use of "a = F/m", I am not doing a full physics simulation here. "steering" is divided by mass just to make sure the steering force is proportional to the mass of the entity producing it. I am not using acceleration whatsoever in the tutorial :)</p>

<p>Thank you for your replay. I finally figure out the reason why I can not get it. Steering Behaviors is kind of Game AI.That means we can not ignore the context we use it.So I will use it in my gameplay logic under a game engine.The various kinds of steering behaviors create various forces during each game loop and "Seek force" is one of them.The acceleration is involved anyway , because the whole simulation is based on physics formular , so that there are different kinds forces there. But it seems that we always stay focus on velocity rather than force or acceleration because of the first reason caused me confused that the MASS we used for every game object here is default considered as 1(not necessary).So the calculation process is simplified and "a = F/M" is equal to "a = F" at the same time.<br>Another reason is a bit obscure and prone to be ignored. Based on the Euler integration , we do the update each frame during delta_t. And the definition of acceleration is the change rate of velocity by time.It indicates that the "Seek force" we calculated is just the "change" part of the velocity and this happens during the delta_t. So the whole picture is that:<br>F = ma = 1 x "Seek force" = desired_velocity - current_velocity.<br>And we can make Mass to be any number we want and the Steering Behaviors still make sense.By the way, we can not think something in an isolated way , because the whole thing is a big system that can do work.</p>

<p>They are different, but can eventually be the same. "desired_velocity" is a vector always pointing to the target, it's a force that pushes the character straight to the target. On the other hand the "velocity" is a vector pointing to anywhere (which is the character's direction).</p><p>The steering force is a vector calculated based on the desired_velocity and the character's current velocity. The steering force will be a vector that, added to the player's velocity, will make it turn until "velocity == desired_velocity". When it happens, the steering force will be 0 (as you said), meaning that no steering force is required anymore to push the characters towards the target, it's already on its way.</p><p>Is it clear now?</p>

<p>Yes thank you. I think it became even more clear when I downloaded the files and studied the actual code in there to get the whole picture. I implemented it in a javacript project and it worked really good. Awesome!</p>

<p>I also get a bit confuse, I implement mine on C++ SFML, I can't figure out how to compute the current_velocity. I studied the actual code but I can't see how the actual current_velocity is computed. Mine works but it doesn't steer, it is similar to the one without steering force applied.</p><p>I need help :(.</p>

<p>The current_velocity is the character's velocity AND direction. In my example, it starts pointing up: e.g. velocity = new Vector(-1, -1).</p><p>As the steering forces act upon it, the velocity changes over time, eventually pointing towards the target. Try not to add the steering force in your code and check if the character moves. If it does not move, your movement code (the one that uses Euler integration) is not working properly.</p>

<p>Great tutorial, but difficult to follow at times. There's so many repeated lines of code it's hard to know what you're replacing and what you're adding to it, especially with no source code. At times, it feels incomplete as well, like with the exclusion of the arrive() function. It's hard to tell how you're building this system</p>

<p>Thank you! For this tutorial, I've tried to keep the focus on the theoretical side of things by using pseudo-code to express the ideas. Maybe if I had used a notation of functions it would have being more clear to understand. I will think about that.</p><p>I am a bit confused about the arrive() function you mentioned though. Are you commenting about another tutorial (the arrive behavior maybe)?</p>

<p>It was on the leader following tutorial. I had thought the tutorials were linked together so as to accomplish one thing, but I see now that they offer ways of accomplishing different things. Anyway, yes, the arrive behavior is sort of detailed in the Arrive and Flee, but how it, as a vector, interacts with the Behind point and the followLeader() force was mostly just a guess. I couldn't tell how the arrive() function would work because you have it interacting with steering and desired velocity, but the ways you implement steering and desired velocity are different across the tutorials. It might help to detail how you envisioned the arrive function to work</p>

I'm new to as3 and I'm having some trouble implementing the tutorial code into my project (a battleship simulator with AI-controlled enemies).</p><p>The problem is that I don't exactly know how to set my battleship movieclip as the "target" and my enemy movieclip as the "boid".

<p>Hey there! In my code, the boid class represents an entity with a position (x and y properties) and a few other things, such as a velocity and a position vector. Movieclips don't have all that.</p><p>What I recommend you is to create the Boid class just like I did, making it extend the MovieClip class. It should work for you.</p>

<p>Thank you! The jittery happens because of small additions to the steering force vector, which causes the vector to slightly point to the left (or right) of the target. I think you can fix that by tweaking MAX_FORCE.</p><p>I'm sorry for the late reply, I saw your comment just now.</p>

<p>Thanks for the good work! I'm implementing some basic steering in C# and looked at your truncate() code, which puzzels me a bit ^^</p><p>i = max / vector.length;<br>i = i &lt; 1.0 ? 1.0 : i;<br>vector.scaleBy(i);</p><p>When the vector's magnitude is smaller than max, then i get's greater than 1 and or vector is scaled up.<br>When the vector's magnitude is smaller than max, i is set to 1 and the vector is scaled with 1, so essentially stays the same. Right?<br>In C# i currently implemented this, which seems to work fine :)</p><p>return (vector.magnitude &gt; max) ? vector.normalized * max : vector;</p><p>Or is my understanding of truncate completely wrong? :D</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks! It's hard to guess what is happening without the code, but if the boids are slowing down, it means the velocity (or the steering force) is not calculated accurately.</p><p>It usually happens when you normalize the wrong vectors or something like that. You can download the tutorial's source code and check if your code is similar (or equivalent, if you are not using AS3).</p>
