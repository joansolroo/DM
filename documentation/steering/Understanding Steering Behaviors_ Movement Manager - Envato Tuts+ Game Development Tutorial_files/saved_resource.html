That's a very interesting question. I've tried to explain it in the first tutorial of the series (http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-steering-behaviors-seek--gamedev-849), but the idea is that a math vector can be used as a representation of a position too.\n\nIf you simply interpret a math vector as an \"arrow\", something that points towards a direction, you can imagine that the head of the arrow is a position (a point in space). The position defined as a Vector can be seen as a point in space, but it is just a way of \"seeing\" it. It continues to be a vector, even though you interpret it as a point. As a result, the position (which is a vector) can be added to another vector, say the velocity vector. The result is a new vector: R = P + V, where R is the new vector that represents P dislocated by the size of V. When you perform an operation as P = P + V, where P is a position and V is velocity, both math vectors, you are performing something called Euler integration. It changes the position P of something based on a velocity vector V. The greater the vector V, the greater is the movement applied to P in every step. They are all math vectors, but if you use P as a point in space, then you can use it to position your elements on the screen.\n\nI hope you got it now.

<p>Thanks! That's a very interesting question. I've tried to explain it in the first tutorial of the series (<a href="http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-steering-behaviors-seek--gamedev-849)" rel="nofollow">http://gamedevelopment.tutsplu...</a>, but the idea is that a math vector can be used as a representation of a position too.</p><p>If you simply interpret a math vector as an "arrow", something that points towards a direction, you can imagine that the head of the arrow is a position (a point in space). The position defined as a Vector can be seen as a point in space, but it is just a way of "seeing" it. It continues to be a vector, even though you interpret it as a point. As a result, the position (which is a vector) can be added to another vector, say the velocity vector. The result is a new vector: R = P + V, where R is the new vector that represents P dislocated by the size of V. When you perform an operation as P = P + V, where P is a position and V is velocity, both math vectors, you are performing something called Euler integration. It changes the position P of something based on a velocity vector V. The greater the vector V, the greater is the movement applied to P in every step. They are all math vectors, but if you use P as a point in space, then you can use it to position your elements on the screen.</p><p>I hope you got it now. If you have questions, fire them away!</p>

<p>As a side . I have begun to translate this into objective-c (if anyone else is keen to know) for my own usage in my game. Just to clarify: is "truncate" synonymous for "clamp"? and if so whats the underlying function of truncate (so that I can convert this correctly).</p>
